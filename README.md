# CyberMind

* Are you working with multiple devices alternatively and would like to have access to all your data on all your 
devices, automatically synched?
* Do you hesitate before putting an email in _one_ box, because it might fit 
into two, three or more boxes?
* Would you like to remember which file was important for that email you're 
reading?
* Are you confused with having a tree in the filesystem, as most files belong 
to two, three or more projects?
* Do you like thinking not linearly, not in trees, but in a matrix where emails, 
chat, files, sms and more are interconnected?

If you answer most of these questions with 'yes', then CyberMind is for
you. The idea is very simple: 
* Input-modules collect your data and adds automatically available tags 
(date, sender, receiver, keywords).
* Your data is synced across devices and user accounts
* You can add any tag you want to one, two or more elements to connect them 
together.
* Using the UI you can arrange your tags into projects and browse your data.

CyberMind is distributed: a node runs on your laptop, another on the server,
and one on your phone to read/write SMS and WhatsApp. Of course you can also
give access-rights to nodes from your friends and share, link and browse
whatever they opened for you.

It is free as in GPLv3 or later, but we can offer you some additional services:
* server-node for connecting your computer with your phone
* space for your data: backup and share data with others

Of course we're happy to have feedback and additional modules for our cybermind.

## Roadmap

After some initial ideas in 2017, some code in 2018, this is a next try to get things rolling:

1. Start with the DB representation
2. Add a file module
3. Add a sync module between computers / servers
4. Add a UI to search

Current effort, as of January 2020: 1.
